. Believe this is currently done - Code out so that creeps aren't built until energy capacities are reached (unless there are currently 0 of that type of creep)
    - Danger of this is if it builds a really large creep and then has to wait all that time to recollect enough energy for next creep of that size :( - think that makes next step really important!
    - Also need to consider bots with attack and how long you'd want to wait for them....
. Code out so that we can specify a min / max creep size to be built - may not want to build tiny+ until we have roads for them to travel on

. Have to add minority roles checking into all of the classes, similar to how upgraders currently have.
. Switch Road / Wall building to Pavers and Masons away from Builders

. Code Attack / Defense Actions and Roles

. Code Bot Naming
