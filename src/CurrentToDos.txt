. Code out so that creeps aren't built until energy capacities are reached (unless there are currently 0 of that type of creep)

. Have to add minority roles checking into all of the classes, similar to how upgraders currently have.
. Switch Road / Wall building to Pavers and Masons away from Builders
. Code Attack / Defense Actions and Roles
. Code Bot Naming
