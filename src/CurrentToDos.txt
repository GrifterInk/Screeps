. Update plan Road to use flags.  (Probably have to update logic for Pavers to be based on flags and not road const. sites?) -> Flags don't have 100 limit, and won't die if an opposing screep runs over them (apparently)
        Be sure to use a specific  color to indicate it's a road flag.  Then we can use other color flags for diff. structures.

-> Extensions / Walls available at Controller Level 2.  Should try to have planner set up early extensions near spawner.

. Consider a "Planner" role that prioritizes creating construction sites (Roads/Towers/Walls/etc.)

. Make code more efficient - things like saving paths and reusing them

. Make code completely AI only - have to figure out how to build structures and where

. Code Attack / Defense Actions and Roles

. Code Bot Naming / Role coloring???
