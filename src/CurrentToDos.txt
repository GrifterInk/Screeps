. Consider a "Planner" role that prioritizes creating construction sites (Roads/Towers/Walls/etc.)
. Action.PlanRoad (for Pavers) - if possible, should visualize a path from one structure to another, and if there are spots without road and without road construction site, it should place a road construction site.

. Make code more efficient - things like saving paths and reusing them


. Make code completely AI only - have to figure out how to build structures and where

. Code Attack / Defense Actions and Roles

. Code Bot Naming
